## Challenges
Some challenges I ran into was getting the notes to delete. With help of classmates I was able to successfully delete the notes!
Another challenge I had was getting the app to run on Heroku. Once again, with help from instrcutors, I was able to deploy it successfully. I am grateful for an aweseome team that continue to encourage and teach me.
